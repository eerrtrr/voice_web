## Required

 - **npm/nodejs**
 You need to have nodejs and npm to hopefully see one day this project works.
 For **Mac & Windows**, just download nodejs installer  (search on the internet).
 For **Linux OS**, the npm package is enought to install both. (`sudo apt install npm` for ubuntu for exemple).
 &nbsp;
 - **Angular**
The end will entirely be with you cmd/terminal. Open it and simply type `npm install -g @angular/cli`. Angular and its tools will automatically be installed!

**I recommend you to restart you pc after that, lots of packages have been installed**
&nbsp;


## Create and build the project

 - **Create Angular folder**
 Go into a folder where you want to stock the project with angular. Select your preferred way to change you terminal directory into this folder. Then type `ng new "folder-name"`, replace folder-name with what you want. A bunch of things will be display, choose **yes** for angular routine and **css** for stylesheet format. That's all! You just create your main folder.
  &nbsp;
 - **Build the project**
 With you terminal go into the folder that you've just create. Replace all files and folder which are into the src folder with what's you've download from this repositories. Then type into your terminal `ng serve --open`, Angular will compile the project and open your favorite web browser to show you the futur.
