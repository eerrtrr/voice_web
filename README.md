## Required

 - **Linux Operating System**
 This project is only available on linux for the moment.
 It requires some packages so make sure you have it all before running the program.

 &nbsp;
 - **Package : npm/nodejs**
 You need to have nodejs and npm to hopefully see one day this project works.
 The npm package is enough to install both.
 `sudo apt install npm` for apt systems.

 &nbsp;
 - **Package : Angular**
 Install it via your terminal : `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`.

 &nbsp;
 - **Package : JSON server**
 Install it via your terminal : `sudo npm install -g json-server`.

 &nbsp;
 - **Package : Googler**
 Install it via your terminal : `sudo apt install googler` for apt systems.

**I recommend you to restart you pc after that, lots of packages have been installed**
&nbsp;


## Create and build the project

 - **Create Angular folder**
 Go into a folder where you want to keep the project with angular.
 Open a terminal and then type `ng new "folder-name"`, replace "folder-name" with the name you want.
 A bunch of things will be displayed,
 - Choose **yes** for angular routine
 - Choose **css** for stylesheet format
 That's all! You've just created your main folder.

  &nbsp;
 - **Build the project**
 Go into your main folder and remove the folder "src".
 Take all the files you have just downloaded from the repository and paste them here.
 You will be asked to replace some files, just say **yes**.
 (The src folder replaces the one you've just deleted).
 Your project is now built.

  &nbsp;
 - **Run the project**
 Open a terminal into your main folder.
 Then type command `./run`.
 The project is running.
 Angular will compile the project and open your favorite web browser to show you the future.
